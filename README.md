## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn more about website accessibility in HTML and CSS by adding semantic HTML elements alongside alternative (alt) tags for images. I built this project as website accessibility was something I had limited knowledge in and I wished to expand my understanding of the ideal ways to make a site more accessible. I did this in 2 major ways. Firstly, I added semantic HTML elements throughout the index.html file. Before this, div elements were used; however using div elements meant that there was a lack of clarity as to the meaning behind each element. This has since been fixed with a variety of semantic HTML elements being used to improve the readability of the HTML code. Secondly, I added alt tags to the images in the HTML file. Adding this allows greater accessibility as it provides a description of an image for people who are unable to view the image. Adding elements of accessibility to this project helps so that anyone can access the webpage. This enables any potential user, such as those with disabilities, to have a good user experience. I learnt a lot throughout this project. As mentioned I learnt a lot about accessibility and why it should be implemented, to ensure everyone can have access to a good user experience. I also learnt a lot about semantic HTML. I learnt about how and why it should be added and I also learnt about which elements should be used depending on the context of the HTML.
